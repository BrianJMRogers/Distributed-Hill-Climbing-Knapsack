# What is this? #

Great question. You're looking at a [hill climbing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hill_climbing) algorithm which solves the [knapsack problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knapsack_problem). This program distributes it's workload to client nodes thereby allowing a large number of tests to be run quickly and returning the best possible knapsack.

# How to run the program #

### Pull ###

You can clone the repo by:
1. Clicking the "Clone or download" button and copying the now visible URL
2. running the following command from the command line ```git clone <copied URL> ```

Now that you have cloned the repository, you can get into running the program.

### The server ###

The server is fairly straightforward. Navigating to the Server Files folder you'll find two files:
1. ```HillClimbingServer.java```
2. ```serverRun.sh```
